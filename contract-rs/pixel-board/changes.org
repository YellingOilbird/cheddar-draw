* Changes

- renamed Avocado to Cream
- renamed Banana to Cheddar

Functions:
- removed get_free_drawing_timestamp
- draw doesn't mint cheddar. added `withdraw_crop()` to draw cheddar!
  NOTE:  need to add "farm" button in the game, which will cal `withdraw_crop`

Values:
- pixel cost = 1 Cream  (instead of 1e18)
- pixel token (cream) price = 1NEAR / 200 (instead of 1/250)
- DEFAULT_CREAM_BALANCE = 2 (instead of 25)

Cream is denominated in full  values (1e1) instead of 1e24
